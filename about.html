              <p> What can I say about my name it's Alex, that's my title, it
               tells you who I am. I was given this name by my mother when I was born. Many things
               can be said about my name. I personally like the name for instance, when you say the
               name Anthony it stands out for some reason I don't know why but it does, one day I will
               I don't believe I inherited my name from anyone in my family on my mother or
               my father's side, my name is an Alex original. I do believe in inheriting and shaping the
               meaning of a name. Like my cousin Vanessa, she inherited that name from my
               grandmother on my mother's side. As it turns out I did trace my name back to biblical
               times, Alex was a Saint. I don't exactly know what he did to be a Saint, all I know is
               that Saint Alex was a Saint. When I was about 12 Alex was associated with the
               Nickname Alex so all through middle school I was called "Alex Bologney Chesse and
               Macaroni" till this day I still hate that name. One day I was walking in class the lights were
               off and to my surprise the lights went on and all in unison everyone was screaming Happy
               Birthday "Alex Bologney Chesse and Macaroni" I was laughing hysterically, that was a
               One big quality that I associate with my name is that my mother pick it out of
               millions of other names. Another quality that I associate with my name is politness,
               everywhere I go no matter who I'm talking to, It could be someone I hate, I would be
               polite. One day in August 1997 I was in a situation that was beyond my control these two
               big guys were coming up to me, and the funny thing is they were my age, anyway this guy
               was big and muscular. He was white with blonde hair and blue eyes. He was so big
               could throw me into a fence like a fly hitting a wind shield going 60 mph. The other guy was
               white, with dark brown hair and the biggest eyebrows I've eve Education means considerably more than just teaching a student to read, write, and
               manipulate numbers. Computers, the Internet, and advanced electronic devices are
               becoming essential in everyday life and have changed the way information is gathered.
               How this new technology is utilized in the curriculum and managed by teachers will have an
               important role to play in widening the resource and knowledge base for all students.
               Technology affects the way teachers teach and students learn. To make the best use of
               information technology (IT), schools need a workable plan to fully integrate it into all
               aspects of the curriculum so students are taught how, why, and when to use technology to
               further enhance their learning. If a school does not have a clear plan of how and why it wishes to implement IT, then it
               runs the risk of wasting money. In schools today, nearly all classrooms have access to a
               computer. However, many schools mistake this as incorporating information technology
               into the curriculum. School staff need to research what IT is available and what would best
               serve the school's purpose, not simply purchase the latest equipment. There should be a
               policy stating how IT is going to assist pupils' development and what teachers want pupils
               to achieve (Reksten, 2000). Staff members need to be clear about what they want IT to do
               for them before they can start incorporating it into their lessons. The only way information technology is going to be useful to schools is if all staff members
               are well-informed and fully supported. It is the principal's responsibility, and should be part
               of the school's plan, to ensure that all staff are consulted about the changes, and that the
               change is carefully organised. Some teachers may be resistant, especially if they have not
               had much experience with computers, so training teachers is essential in implementing IT
               into the school curriculum. Staff members must feel involved in the process of acquiring
               technology, and in learning how to operate it, in order for them to increase their confidence
               in using IT as a curriculum tool. Teachers are only going to be able to incorporate IT into
               their lessons if they are competent users themselves (Reksten, 2000). It is vitally important for students to be taught the strategies for using IT. Children also need to be
               fully informed about the capabilities of IT before being asked to use it. Pupils should be aware that
               the contexts in which they use IT will change, and they need to know what the appropriate use of
               IT is and what is not. Whilst it is important that children learn to use IT effectively, teachers must
               emphasise that IT is not always suitable. According to Apter (1968),
               the danger is that the “computer dehumanizes people and inevitably leads them to act
               like machines themselves” (p. 58). Teachers must make sure they plan to use variety in
               their lessons. Too much IT instruction may be just as harmful to a child as not enough.
